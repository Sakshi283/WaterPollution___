    <h1>Effects of Water Pollution</h1>
    <p>Following are some important effects of various types of water
        pollutants:</p>
       <p> <ul>
        <li><span>Oxygen demanding wastes:</span> Organic matter which reaches water
        bodies is decomposed by micro-organisms present in water. For this
        degradation oxygen dissolved in water is consumed. Dissolved oxygen
        (DO) is the amount of oxygen dissolved in a given quantity of water at
        a particular temperature and atmospheric pressure. Amount of dissolved
        oxygen depends on aeration, photosynthetic activity in water,
        respiration of animals and plants and ambient temperature.
        The saturation value of DO varies from 8-15 mg/L. For active
        fish species (trout and Salmon) 5-8 mg/L of DO is required whereas
        less desirable species like carp can survive at 3.0 mg/L of DO.
        Lower DO may be harmful to animals especially fish population.
        Oxygen depletion (deoxygenation) helps in release of phosphates from
        bottom sediments and causes eutrophication.</li></p>
        <p><li><span>Nitrogen and Phosphorus Compounds (Nutrients):</span> Addition of
            compounds containing nitrogen and phosphorus helps in the growth
            of algae and other plants which when die and decay consume oxygen
            of water. Under anaerobic conditions foul smelling gases are produced.
            Excess growth or decomposition of plant material will change the
            concentration of CO2 which will further change pH of water. Changes
            in pH, oxygen and temperature will change many physico-chemical
            characteristics of water.</li></p>
           <p><li><span>Pathogens:</span> Many wastewaters especially sewage contain many
            pathogenic (disease causing) and non-pathogenic micro-organisms and
            many viruses. Water borne diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid,
            jaundice etc. are spread by water contaminated with sewage.</li></p>
            <p><li><span>Toxic Compounds:</span> Pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides,
            cyanides and many other organic and inorganic compounds are harmful
            to aquatic organisms.</li></p>
            <p><li>The demand of DO increases with addition of biodegradable
            organic matter which is expressed as biological oxygen demand (BOD).
            BOD is defined as the amount of DO required to aerobically decompose
            biodegradable organic matter of a given volume of water over a period
            of 5 days at 20Â°C. More BOD values of any water sample are associated
            with poor water quality. The non-biodegradable toxic compounds
            biomagnify in the food chain and cause toxic effects at various levels of
            food chain.</li></p>
            <p><li>Some of these substances like pesticides, methyl mercury etc. move
            into the bodies of organisms from the medium in which these organisms
            live. Substances like DDT are not water soluble and have affinity for
            body lipids. These substances tend to accumulate in the organisms
            body. This process is called bioaccumulation. The concentration of
            these toxic substances builds up at successive levels of food chain. This
            process is called biomagnification. </li></ul></p><p>Following is the example of biomagnification of DDT in aquatic food chain:</p>
    <p><ul type="square"><li><span class="s">Toxic substances</span> polluting the water ultimately affect human
        health. Some heavy metals like lead, mercury and cadmium cause
        various types of diseases. Mercury dumped into water is transformed
        into water soluble methyl mercury by bacterial action. Methyl mercury
        accumulates in fish. In 1953, people in Japan suffered from numbness
        of body parts, vision and hearing problems and abnormal mental
        behaviour. This disease called Minamata disease occurred due to
        consumption of methyl mercury contaminated fish caught from
        Minamata bay in Japan. The disease claimed 50 lives and permanently
        paralysed over 700 persons. Pollution by another heavy metal cadmium
        had caused the disease called Itai-itai in the people of Japan. The disease
        was caused by cadmium contaminated rice. The rice fields were irrigated
        with effluents of zinc smelters and drainage water from mines. In this
        disease bones, liver, kidney, lungs, pancreas and thyroid are affected.</li></p>
       <p> <li><span class="s">Arsenic pollution</span> of ground water in Bangladesh and West Bengal
        is causing various types of abnormalities.</li></p>
       <p><li><span>Nitrate</span> present in excess in drinking water causes blue baby
        syndrome or methaemoglobinemia. The disease develops when a part
        of haemoglobin is converted into non-functional oxidized form.
        Nitrate in stomach partly gets changed into nitrites which can
        produce cancer-causing products in the stomach.</li></p>
        <p><li>Excess of <span>fluoride</span> in drinking water causes defects in teeth and
        bones called fluorosis.</li></p>
        <p><li><span>Pesticides</span> in drinking water ultimately reach humans and are
        known to cause various health problems. DDT, aldrin, dieldrin etc.
        have therefore, been banned. Recently, in Andhra Pradesh, people
        suffered from various abnormalities due to consumption of endosulphan
        contaminated cashew nuts.</li></ul>
